 A simple Aunction Project
 * What is the scope of this project?
 * Build a aunction for an ecommerce website
 * This aunction is to have a start time, end time, can be cancelled, and once it has ended, persons who participated in the auntion will request for their money.
 * What are the things we are considering"
 * a. construtor, an enum to indicate to us when the aunction commences or otherwise,
 * b. a function to indicate deposits for the aunction
 * c. a function to increase the bids, to help us identify the highest bidder.
 * d. a function to allow participants to rewuest for their ether once the aunction is over.
 * e. let's see if we can deploy and create a smart contract to interact with our contract.
 Since it's ecommerce we can't save our pictures and activities on the blockchain, that's gas inefficient, however, we can use ipfs and save the hash.
